<H1>Arduino Firmware for a DCC Model Train Controller</H1>

<H2>Firmware</H2>
So now that I had assembled the <A HREF="">hardware</A>, it was firmware time. I wanted to send an address:direction:speed string (eg "A001:F:S3") over the serial connect to the Arduino, and have the Arduino build the corresponding DCC packet. The Arduino would then drive the H-Bridge accordingly.

The Arduino firmware I wrote to implement the DCC spec is interesting from two respects: it uses timer interrupts and it writes to the microcontroller ports directly. But I'm getting ahead of myself a little...

<H2>DCC Specification</H2>
Before going any further, we'd probably need to have a look at the DCC <A HREF="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/DCCStds.html">spec</A>. DCC sends 1's and 0's as square waves of different lengths. A short square wave (58us * 2) represents a 1, and a longer one (>95us) is a 0.

<IMG SRC="dcc_signals.png">

These 1's and 0's are then collected into packets and transmitted on to the rails. Each packet contains (at least):
<OL>
    <LI>A preamble of eleven 1's</LI>
    <LI>An address octet. This is the address of the train you want to control on the layout.</LI>
    <LI>A command octet. This is 1 bit for direction and 7 bits for speed.</LI>
    <LI>An error checking octet. This is the address octed XORed with the command octet</LI>
</OL>
Each of these sections is separated by a "0" and the packet ends with a "1" bit.
If a train picks up a control packet that is not addresses to it, the command is ignored. The train keeps doing what it was last instructed to do, all the while still taking power from the rails. When nothing has to be changed, power must still be supplied to the trains so packets are still broadcast on the rails to supply power - either the previous commands can be repeated or idle packets sent.

<H2>Driving the H-Bridge</H2>
First, I had to figure out a way of driving the H-Bridge signals. To avoid shorting out the supply rails, I have to drive the H-Bridge control signals differentially - both must change at the same time. This ruled out using <CODE>digital_write()</CODE> to set pin states for two reasons: it can only change one pin at a time; and it's <A HREF="http://www.billporter.info/ready-set-oscillate-the-fastest-way-to-change-arduino-pins/">too slow</A>.

So I needed to directly manipulate the a microcontroller digital port. I chose pins 11 and 12 which are both in <A HREF="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Atmega168Hardware">PORTB</A>. By <A HREF="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation">directly manipulating</A> PORTB with a macro, I could now change the pins at the same instant in time.

<PRE>
#include <avr/io.h>
#define DRIVE_1() PORTB = B00010000
#define DRIVE_0() PORTB = B00001000
</PRE>

When to use these macros was the next problem.

<H2>Timing</H2>
As the DCC spec specifies quite a tight timing requirement on the 1 and 0 waveforms, I decided I should use the timer on the Arduino's microcontroller. Using the timer, I could place the transistions on the outputs accurately. So I set up the timer so that the interrupt would trigger every 58us. To simplify things, I defined the time of a 0 bit to be twice that of the 1 bit, ie 116us between transitions.

<PRE>void configure_for_dcc_timing() {

  /* DCC timing requires that the data toggles every 58us
  for a '1'. So, we set up timer2 to fire an interrupt every
  58us, and we'll change the output in the interrupt service 
  routine.
 
  Prescaler: set to divide-by-8 (B'010)
  Compare target: 58us / ( 1 / ( 16MHz/8) ) = 116
  */

  // Set prescaler to div-by-8
  bitClear(TCCR2B, CS22);
  bitSet(TCCR2B, CS21);
  bitClear(TCCR2B, CS20);
  
  // Set counter target
  OCR2A = timer2_target;
    
  // Enable Timer2 interrupt
  bitSet(TIMSK2, OCIE2A); 
}
</PRE>

I'd have other things to do in the timer interrupt routine, so it was important to zero the counter and toggle the output pins straight away to keep the timing accurate.

<PRE>
#include <avr/interrupt.h> 

...

ISR( TIMER2_COMPA_vect ){
  TCNT2 = 0; // Reset Timer2 counter to divide...

  boolean bit_ = bitRead(dcc_bit_pattern_buffered[c_buf>>3], c_buf & 7 );

  if( bit_ ) {
    DRIVE_1();
  } else {
    DRIVE_0();
  }  
  
  ... other stuff ...
};
</PRE>

<H2>Building Control Packets</H2>
I wanted the ISR for the timer to be as short as possible. Now that I'd settled on transmitting a "0" twice as slow as a "1", the packet size in Unit Intervals (UIs, ie 58us) were going to be different depending on the data transmitted.
